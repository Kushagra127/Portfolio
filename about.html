        <p>I am a final year Undergraduate pursuing B.Tech in computer Science from IIIT Bhubaneswar.
            From an early age Iâ€™ve always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest.
             I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.
            This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made.
             From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.
